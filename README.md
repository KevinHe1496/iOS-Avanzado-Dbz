# Dragon Ball App

**Dragon Ball App** is an iOS application developed in Swift, designed to display Dragon Ball characters along with their descriptions and transformations.  
The project includes a **Login** system for user authentication and uses **Core Data** for local storage.  
It also integrates a **REST API** to fetch character data and leverages **MapKit** and **CoreLocation** to display each character’s location on an interactive map.  
**Unit Testing** is implemented to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Project Implementation

The app provides a workflow that allows users to browse a list of characters and view their details.  
When selecting a transformation, users can access more specific information about it.  
Additionally, the app enables viewing each character’s location through interactive maps.
